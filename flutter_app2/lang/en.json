"messageText": "This application is based on Harris Benedict's equation.   Although Harris Benedict developed his equation almost 100 years ago and published in his study called Human basic metabolic rate in 1919. Modern studies show that his formula overestimate energy consumption with more than 5%. Because this app will be used by a lot of people who want to lose some weight, we will use another formula, known as Mifflin's equation, and was published in february 1990 number of the magazine American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, with title: A new equation to predict number of calories needed for healthy persons. Mifflin's equation:  For man: RMB (CER) = 5 + 10(weight) + 6.25 (height) - 5 (age)  For woman: RMB (CER) = -161 + 10 (weight) + 6.25 (height) - 5 (age). The result is measured in kcal/day.   Once we get the basic metabolic rate value (BMR) we multiply it with our activity level and the result will be our total number of calories needed per day. ",
